## Project Overview

**Delmon Diver** is a **3D level-based survival adventure game** built in **Unity (C#)** as a university group project for the course **IT8101: Game Development** at **Bahrain Polytechnic** (Department of ICT, Section 6 Group 3).

### Game Premise

The player is a **diver** whose boat breaks in the middle of the sea during a storm. He must survive, collect resources, craft tools, build boats, explore islands and underwater areas, and ultimately **return to his home island**. An optional **treasure-hunting side story** can change the game's ending.

The game is culturally inspired by **Bahrain's pearl diving traditions and maritime heritage** (the ancient Dilmun/Delmon civilization). Visual references include *Subnautica*, *Uncharted 3*, *Ark: Survival Evolved*, and *Sea of Thieves*.

## Git Branching Strategy

The team uses **per-member feature branches** that merge into integration branches.

### Branch Overview

| Branch                     | Owner/Purpose                                                    | Status       |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `main`                     | Stable baseline (initial project setup)                          | Base         |
| `testShip`                 | Character, movement, loading, sprites, environment detection     | Merged → `the_ship_level1` |
| `the_ship_level1` ★        | **Level 1 development branch**. Sunken ship environment, water shader, buoyancy, character, movement, environment detection. Merged from `testShip`. | Active       |
| `Batool`                   | Character + movement, loading screen, sprites, ship environment  | Active       |
| `Abbas`                    | Base only (no additional commits)                                | Inactive     |
| `Hoor`                     | Intro story, main menu, UI                                      | Merged       |
| `Mohamed`                  | Water, boat, main menu                                          | Merged       |
| `Mohamed2`                 | Settings (audio, display, resolution, volume, mute, reset)       | Active       |
| `Abdulla`                  | Basic reward system foundation                                  | Feature      |
| `Settings`                 | Audio mixer, settings menu                                      | Merged→Hoor  |
| `Fungus_Level1_Intro`      | Level 1 narrative intro using Fungus, scene renaming, map scenes | Merged       |
| `merge_level1`             | Integration branch merging Fungus + main menu + settings + map videos | Integration |
| `LLM_Parrot`               | LLM-based AI parrot companion scripts, chat UI                  | Feature      |

### Branching Conventions
- Personal branches are named after team members (e.g., `Batool`, `Abbas`, `Mohamed2`)
- Feature branches are descriptive (e.g., `LLM_Parrot`, `Fungus_Level1_Intro`)
- `merge_level1` serves as the Level 1 integration branch
- PRs are used for cross-branch merges (e.g., PR #1 merged `Mohamed2` into `merge_level1`)

---

## Code Architecture & Patterns

### Singletons
Both `MusicManager` and `SoundManager` use the singleton pattern with `DontDestroyOnLoad`:
```csharp
public static MusicManager Instance;
void Awake() {
    if (Instance != null) Destroy(gameObject);
    else { Instance = this; DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); }
}
```

### Audio System Design
```
MusicManager (singleton)
├── MusicLibrary (trackName → AudioClip mapping)
└── AudioSource (crossfade between tracks)

SoundManager (singleton)
├── SoundLibrary (groupID → AudioClip[] with random selection)
└── AudioSource (2D playback)
    + PlayClipAtPoint for 3D positional audio

MainAudio
├── AudioMixer ("MusicVolume", "SFXVolume" exposed params)
└── PlayerPrefs persistence for volume settings
```

### Scene Loading Pattern
- **Video transitions**: `LoadAfterMap` listens to `VideoPlayer.loopPointReached`, waits `delay` seconds, then loads `nextScene`
- **Timeline transitions**: `LoadMainMenu` listens to `PlayableDirector.stopped`, then loads `nextScene`
- **Menu navigation**: `MainMenuManager.StartGame()` directly calls `SceneManager.LoadScene("L1_Map")`

### UI Pattern
- Canvas-based UI with `CanvasGroup` for fade transitions
- Panel show/hide via `SetActive(true/false)`
- Fade coroutine using `Mathf.Lerp` on `CanvasGroup.alpha`

---

## Planned Core Systems (From GDD)

These are the MVP systems described in the Game Design Document:

1. **Player Movement** — Walking, jumping, swimming on surface (KBM + controller)
2. **Parkour Traversal** — Vaulting, wall-climb, ledge grab (context-sensitive)
3. **Diving** — Dive key, underwater swimming, oxygen/air timer, buoyancy physics
4. **Combat** — Basic melee attack + block, enemy hit reactions, player health
5. **Enemy AI** — State machine (idle → pursue → attack), patrol areas
6. **Level Objectives** — HUD tracker (list style), trigger-based completion
7. **Level Progression** — Complete objective → next level loads
8. **Core UI/HUD** — Health bar, oxygen bar (diving), objective tracker, pause menu, inventory

### Planned Custom Features
1. **Journey Guide (LLM AI Parrot)** — Real-time conversational AI, context-aware advice, Bahraini cultural facts, voice/text interaction
2. **Inventory System** — Categorized (Tools, Artifacts), quick-access hotbar, artifact codex with lore
3. **Current Location Map** — Fog of war, objective markers, weather-affected visibility
4. **Combat System** — Dual modes: land (melee) vs underwater (slow/strategic)
5. **Weather System** — Sandstorms, storms, heat waves, visibility reduction, water currents, enemy behavior changes

## Visual & Art Direction

- **Visual Style**: Semi-realistic 3D, inspired by *Subnautica*
- **Camera**: Third-person perspective
- **Color Palettes**: Distinct per environment:
  - **Underwater General** — Blue-green, sunlit, clear
  - **Underwater Cave** — Dark, moody, flashlight-dependent
  - **Island** — Warm, tropical, natural greens & sandy tones
- **Lighting**: Dynamic per area (sunlit surface vs dark caves)
- **Effects**: Water waves, spray, rain, lightning, screen shake, particle effects on interactions

---

## Audio Design

### Music Tracks (Referenced in GDD)
- **Exploration**: "Omega" by Scott Buckley
- **Cave Diving**: "Thriller" by NastelBom
- **Combat**: "Epic3" by SenorMusica81

### Sound Effects by Level
| Level | Sound Effects |
|-------|---------------|
| L1    | Bubbles, muffled underwater impacts, muffled groaning wood, drowning gasps (near death) |
| L2    | Light ocean waves, soft wind, quiet ambient |
| L3    | Strong waves, rain |
| L4    | Birds, wind through trees, water, animal sounds |
| L4.2  | Echoes, dripping water, low ambient noise |
| L5    | Strong winds, rough waves, pirate ship sounds, distant combat |

---

## Development Conventions

### File Naming
- Scenes: `L{number}_{DescriptiveName}.unity` (e.g., `L1_SunkenShip.unity`)
- Map transitions: `L{from}ToL{to}_Map.unity`
- Scripts: PascalCase class names matching filenames

### Folder Organization
- New prefabs go in the appropriate `Prefabs/` subfolder
- Scripts must be placed in the correct `Scripts/` subfolder by domain
- Third-party assets go in `ThirdParty/` or at the asset root if from Unity Asset Store
- Empty directories use `.gitkeep` to preserve folder structure in Git

### Unity Preferences
- Scenes must be added to **Build Settings** in the correct order (see `EditorBuildSettings.asset`)
- Audio mixer uses exposed parameters named `"MusicVolume"` and `"SFXVolume"`
- Volume persistence uses `PlayerPrefs` with keys `"MusicVolume"` and `"SFXVolume"`

## Important Notes for AI Agents

1. **Currently on `the_ship_level1` branch** — This is the active working branch for Level 1 development, containing character, movement, and the sunken ship environment (merged from `testShip`).

2. **Many systems are stubs** — `LevelProgression`, `SaveLoadManager`, `XPManager`, `Player/`, `Enemies/`, `Systems/` are scaffolded but empty. Check which branch has relevant WIP work before implementing.

3. **Check feature branches before implementing** — Work may already exist on a personal branch:
   - LLM/AI Parrot → `LLM_Parrot` branch
   - Water/Buoyancy → `the_ship_level1` branch (Active for L1)
   - Settings/Audio → `Mohamed2` branch
   - Rewards → `Abdulla` branch

4. **Fungus plugin is read-only** — Do not modify files in `Assets/Fungus/`. Fungus flowcharts are used for Level 1 narrative.

5. **Unity 6 (6000.x)** — This project uses the latest Unity 6 version. APIs may differ from Unity 2022/2023 tutorials.

6. **URP rendering** — All materials and shaders must be URP-compatible.

7. **The game is a university project** — Keep code clean and well-documented. The team is learning, so prefer clear patterns over overly complex abstractions.

8. **Cultural sensitivity** — The game represents Bahraini maritime heritage. Respect the cultural context when implementing dialogue, lore, or character interactions.
